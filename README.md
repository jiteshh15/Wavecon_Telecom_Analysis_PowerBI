## Problem statement
After the 5G launch in May 2022, Wavecon's management noticed a decrease in active users and revenue growth. The director asked the analytics team for a comparison of KPIs pre and post-launch to make informed decisions for recovery. They're also exploring internet plan optimizations to increase active users.
