## Problem statement
Since the 5G launch, Wavecon has seen a drop in active users and revenue growth. The management wants a clear comparison of key metrics (KPIs) from before and after the launch to identify issues and work on solutions. They're also looking for ways to improve internet plans to attract more users.
